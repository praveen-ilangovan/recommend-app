## _Organize, Share, and Inspire: Your Favorites, Simplified._

Recommend is a platform that allows users to organize and share their favorite items across various categories, such as movies, books, hotels, recipes, and more.

Users can create customizable boards, where each board holds multiple cards representing individual items. Boards can be shared with other users, enabling collaborative recommendations and discovery of new content on specific topics. The app fosters a community of sharing and personalized recommendations.

"""
Package: db.abstracts
===================

The `db.abstracts` package contains abstract base classes that define the core
structure and behavior of key components in the recommend_app. These
abstractions ensure that different implementations, such as various database
backends and model types, adhere to a consistent interface.

By using these abstract classes, the application achieves flexibility and
extensibility, allowing developers to switch between different underlying
technologies or introduce new features with minimal changes to the core logic.

Modules within this package include:
------------------------------------
- `abstract_db.py`: Defines the abstract base class for database interactions.

This package plays a crucial role in enforcing a clean architecture and
separation of concerns across the application.

# Recommend

## _Organize, Share, and Inspire: Your Favorites, Simplified._

Recommend is a platform that allows users to organize and share their favorite items across various categories, such as movies, books, hotels, recipes, and more.

Users can create customizable boards, where each board holds multiple cards representing individual items. Boards can be shared with other users, enabling collaborative recommendations and discovery of new content on specific topics. The app fosters a community of sharing and personalized recommendations.

## Tech

 - Python
 - Poetry
 - MongoDB
 - Beanie ODM
 - FastAPI
 - Jinja2 (eventually will be replaced by React)

## Quickstart

 - Clone the repo
 - CD into it
 - Pull the old-main branch
 - Install

```sh
cd recommend-app
git checkout old_main
make install
```

You can checkout the first attempt at the db side of things. 

## What's happening now?

Rethinking the whole idea as a Full Stack App. Gonna rebuild it and this time
parallely working on the API and FE too. This attempt, FE is gonna be written
using Jinja templates. But it will eventually be rewritten using a proper 
framework (React probably)
